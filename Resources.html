                                    <p>The National Center for Transgender Equality advocates to change policies and
                                        society to increase understanding and acceptance of transgender people. In the
                                        nation’s capital and throughout the country, NCTE works to replace disrespect,
                                        discrimination, and violence with empathy, opportunity, and justice.
                                        NCTE envisions a society in which transgender people not only survive, but
                                        thrive, with accepting families and communities, full self-determination over
                                        their identities and bodies, and freedom from disrespect, discrimination and
                                        violence. For this vision to become a reality, we must also create equity, equal
                                        opportunity, safety, health, and economic well-being for all people over their
